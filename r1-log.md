# 100 Days Of Exercise - Log

### Day 2: Wednesday, January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Walked for 30 minutes on the treadmill.

**Thoughts**:  Stupid watch.  I hit the walkout side button and it didn't record my walking.  I didn't realize until i finished.  Ugh.  My leg still aches.

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 09, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Walked for 30 minutes on the treadmill.

**Thoughts**: This was my first strutured walking of 2018.  Last August, my wife and I started a Couch to 5k, [Zombie Style](https://zombiesrungame.com/).  I was able to get to eight weeks, but I couldn't complete my 5k.  My developed some pain in my left leg.  I'm hoping that I can build back up to it.
