## FAQ:
  **Q:** How do I get in touch with the people who are also doing this challenge?  
  **A:** The best way to connect is to use the list of resources available on the official 100DaysOfX site:
  www.100DaysOfX.com/connect 
  
  Search for #100DaysOfX on Twitter.

  **Q:** I've already started the challenge, and I'm currently on Day 8. How can I start using this repo to track my progress?  
  **A:** Don't worry. Restore as much info on the previous days, but if you can't then just continue from where you are right now. If you have been tweeting about your progress every day, put the links to your tweets in the Log for each day. Then, follow the format.  

  **Q:** I’ve missed a day, does it mean I’ve failed the challenge?  
  **A:** Absolutely not. You are allowed to miss one day (then make it up by adding one more day to the end of the 100), but never miss two days in a row. This is a great piece of advice on habit formation.

  **Q:** I come home late, and by the time I am finished with my exercise, it’s past midnight, does it count?  
  **A:** Of course it counts! The rule of thumb is: have you exercise for at least 30 minutes before going to sleep that day? If yes, you are on track.  

  The reason for this is that we all have different schedules and different life periods (kids, school, work, and what have you) so don’t hold yourself to some arbitrary time standard. You will not experience what Cinderella experienced once the clock strikes midnight.  

  **Q:** Should I keep a journal?  
  **A:** Yes you should, and the best way to do that is to fork this repo, and commit to [the Log](r1-log.md) daily. It’s helpful in two major ways: you will be able to look at the progress each day and see how far you’ve already come and it will be easier to find the motivation to continue, and the second one is that after you’ve done your 100 days, you will be able to analyze your experience better and see what worked and what didn’t.

  **Q:** Should I worry about streaks?  
  **A:** Streaks are nice and helpful, but as I mentioned above — don’t worry about them too much and don’t criticize yourself over missing a day. Instead, make sure you do everything to not let that happen again, and know that worrying and scolding yourself will not give you any results. (Ok, It will give you results, but only negative. I would call them consequences, not results) The best way to get out of that negative emotional state is to sit down and code.

  **Q:** What is the most difficult part of this challenge?  
  **A:** The part where you have to go exercise. Don’t postpone that or think about it at all, because you will rationalize yourself out of it. Approach it mechanically.  If you have a treadmill:  go stand on it and turn it on.  After 5 minutes, you will not feel any problems/procrastination/desire to stop.  

  **Q:** If everyone started on a certain day, should I join them on the day they are? For example, from Day 12?  
  **A:** This challenge is individual, so when you join you start at day 1. Whenever you’ll be posting an update on Twitter or elsewhere, make sure to mention which day you are on and use the hashtag so that people can find and support you!
