# Rules of the 100 Days Of Exercise Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will exericse for at least a half hour (30 minutes) every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
January  09th, 2018.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfExercise
2. I will update the [log](r1-log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
3. Any exericse that adds a minute to my apple iwatch exercise ring counts.  This includes walking and/or running.


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
