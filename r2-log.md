**Today's Progress**: Started Week 1 Day 1 of Zombie Couch to 5k

**Thoughts**: I feel pretty bad.  I was basically 1 week away of finishing my first 100 days of exercise.  I basically fell into a black hole and stopped.  This happened to all of my 100 days challenges.  I've starting over again on my Couch to 5k, [Zombie Style](https://zombiesrungame.com/).  I've addressed the pain in my left leg.  I'm hoping that I can build back up to running a 5k.
